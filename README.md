# DailyPill

Daily Pill is a medication reminder app for Android.
I made it to help me remember to take my thyroid medicine, and keep track of the fasting time before breakfast.

By default, Daily Pill shows a reminder every morning, which is visible as soon as you pick up the phone for the first time.
With the press of a single button, you can record the exact time that you took the medicine.
You can do this without needing to unlock your phone or enter your PIN.

Daily Pill is free and open source software.
It does not display ads, and does not collect any personal information.
