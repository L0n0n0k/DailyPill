# A Medication Reminder App

Daily Pill is an easy-to-use medication reminder app for Android.
It is ideal if you need to take your medicine every morning.

Here are some of the main features:

1. **Remembers when you took the medicine.** This is useful if you need to wait a certain amount of time before eating.
2. **Flexible schedule.** The app shows a reminder on your phone's lock screen, which will always be there once you wake up. It works just as well if you wake up early at 5AM, or sleep in until 9AM.
3. **Unobstrusive.** It doesn't set off any noisy alarms. Those just tend to be snoozed, regardless of whether you have taken the medicine or not.
4. **Efficient.** Respoind to the reminders without unlocking your phone or entering your PIN.
5. **Respects your privacy!** Does not display ads, and does not collect any personal information. It's free and open-source software.

Daily Pill is available for download from the Google Play Store or from F-Droid.
